## EventSelection
Use Python to collaborate with eventlist and select the best signal-like data event for the event display. The input data format should like the `example.txt`.

For VBF and GGF, you could modify the python file for the input of the selection tool.

For VBF, 

`python Plot-vbf.py`

For ggF, 

`python Plot-ggf.py`
